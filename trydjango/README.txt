It's perfect tutorial I had seen
it start with building admin site & it will make bloger
I find it very powerfull and I love it
the best way to make invironment here by this codes:
#1# pip install virtualenv
#2# pip install virtualenv --upgrade
#3# cd /path/
#4# virtualenv .

to start a project use this code:
## django-admin.py startproject 'projectName'

to run server use:
## python manage.py runserver

for admin site configuration go to:
## https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/
